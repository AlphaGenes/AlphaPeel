AlphaPeel
===========

AlphaPeel is a software package for calling, phasing, and imputing genotype and sequence data in pedigree populations. This program implements single locus peeling, multi locus peeling, and hybrid peeling. A complete description of these methods is given in <a href="https://gsejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12711-018-0438-2">Hybrid peeling for fast and accurate calling, phasing, and imputation with sequence data of any coverage in pedigrees, Genetics Selection Evolution</a>. 

Availability
============

The AlphaPeel.zip file contains a python3 wheel file, a manual, and an example dataset.

Conditions of use
=================

AlphaPeel is part of a suite of software that our group has developed. It is fully and freely available for all use under the MIT License.
